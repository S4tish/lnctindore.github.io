        <h3>What is computer Engineering?</h3>
        <p>Computer Science Engineering is an integrated field of engineering that combines aspects of Electronic
            Engineering with computer Sciences.It is mainly bifurcated into two parts - Hardware Engineering
            and Software Engineering.As the name reflects , Hardware Engineering is all about constructing a small 
            microchip for large scientific computer.Software Engineering covers designing software for various
            purposes.
            It is not easy to define Computer Engineering in a Statement due to the extensive nature of the 
            field.Computer engineers undertake various responsibilities depending on the industries and their
            place of employment , ranging from the manufacturing of microprocessors to creating and designing
            computer program and algorithm
            Skills Required for software Engineer
